Hi, I'm Akshat Saini, a Power BI enthusiast and data analyst. I've recently completed several projects using Power BI and created this repository to showcase my work and share what I've learned about its powerful data integration, transformation, and visualization features. Through these projects, I've explored advanced analytics with DAX and AI capabilities, and demonstrated how interactive dashboards can enhance collaboration and data sharing.
